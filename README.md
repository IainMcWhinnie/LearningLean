This repository aims to be the collection of notes and solutions to the content and exercises to the book [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html).

For now I'm following the principle that a proof is a proof so the answers to the exercises tend to be fairly unreadable and not always the most efficient. Perhaps I shall revise this at some point.
